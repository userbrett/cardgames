README - cardgames

The card games project supports bundling multiple card games into one package.
Currently, only one example card game is present - Blackjack.

To run it:

    build$ ./build.sh
    build$ java -jar cardgames.jar


Additionally, there is a standalone class:  DeckStuff
This provides just a card deck.

To run it:
    $ javac src/DeckStuff.java 
    $ java  src/DeckStuff 


TODO:
    1. Add another game.
